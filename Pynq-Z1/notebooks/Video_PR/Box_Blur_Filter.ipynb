    "# Box Blur Filter Example\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use the box blur filter. We take advantage of the Pynqâ€™s ability to buffer HDMI signals in order to perform a filter. The box blur filter is relatively simple. As shown in the image below, the value of each pixel outputted is the average of the pixel in the center and the surrounding pixels. \n",

    "*This diagram shows how the blur algorithm functions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform this function, we need access to three rows worth of pixel data. We achieve this by stalling the HDMI signal for two rows while buffering the RGB values of the pixels. Once all the need RGB values are buffered the algorithm is performed and the HDMI output signals are sent."
